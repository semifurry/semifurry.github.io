  <h1>What's a semifurry?</h1>
  <p>I like to consider myself a semifurry. It's not a real term, in fact I just made it up for my profile, so you know I am not a complete furry. Commonly, a lot of people tend to hate furries and I fully understand it. I know how it is, to see furries as cringe, bad human beings, and in a lot of cases, the haters are actually right! I actually became a furry around 3 years ago but started hating them 2 years ago, and now here I am. It's actually not a big deal for me to express what I am, but I'm still questioning myself as a full furry, because some people in the community, and I mean the most of the community, are awful people.</p>
  <h2>Explanation</h2>
  <p>So, let me get started about what do I think a semifurry truly is. I, as a semifurry consider myself a persona (not a fursona!), that tends to like antropomorphic animals, but doesn't have a furry avatar. Semifurry is between a regular person and a furry. They completely understand every habit a furry has, except for some (I don't understand yiff, etc). Being a semifurry is no zoophilia in any way, it's just a thing that some of us humans may like.</p>
  <p>P.S. - Just found that, in fact, someone said it before me! On <a href="https://urbandictionary.com/">Urban Dictionary</a>, someone said this term before me. Search semi-furry on Urban Dictionary!</p>
